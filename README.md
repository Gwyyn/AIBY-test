# AIBY Inc — Test Assignment

This repository contains my test task for **AIBY Inc**: a fullscreen mobile promo page optimized for **iPhone SE, 8, 8+, X, and 12** in portrait mode, with full support for **7 languages**.
The entire project was completed in **2 working days**.

## Overview

The page replicates a native-style subscription screen, including:

* Responsive fullscreen layout for multiple iPhone models
* Automatic language detection + 7-language localization
* Subscription options with dynamic active states
* Adaptive typography and layout for long translated strings
* Clean, lightweight implementation using vanilla HTML/CSS/JS

## Deployment

The project is automatically deployed on:

* [**GitHub Pages**](https://gwyyn.github.io/AIBY-test/)
* [**Vercel**](https://aiby-test-g8155irgl-gwyyns-projects.vercel.app)

Both deployments update instantly on push.
